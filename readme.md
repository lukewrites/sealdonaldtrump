# I'm @sealDonaldTrump. Sad!

Source code for [@sealDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/sealDonaldTrump), a python-based twitter bot that sounds like @realDonaldTrump, with an aquatic twist.

## Technology
Python 3 along with:
* [tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/) (to grab the tweets)
* [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) (to generate the text)
* [nltk](http://nltk.org) (to make the markov model just a bit better)

All [to be] deployed on AWS Lambda. What an amazing world we live in.

## Me

My name's Luke Petschauer. I love working with natural language in Python. Hire me so I can do it full time!
